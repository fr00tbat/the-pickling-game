# Bugs, fixes, Issues


- get_jar function
    -managing lists
    -trying to access an index in the list properly
    -item shouldn't be assigned to 'None'
    -lists are tuples for some reason
[kinda working]
[didn't expect the memory addresses, as the objects have names to be referred to]
>Fix: __repr__ and __str__ methods


- passing the game state around, passing the parameter
getting:
TypeError: consider_pickling_table() missing 1 required positional argument: 'storage_areas'
> on lookup, this can be to do with redundant passing of variables within a class to its methods, when it has an init method that should take care of this already
but I don't understand the connnection here
> It still needs you to pass it the variable via a parameter though, I'm unsure exactly of what's wrong still.
Fix: Just using global variables for now


- study_jar() functions not working quite right - 
> really it's current_jar variable that's not working right
>gettin gNone on printing (where it prints class __str__ from the get_jar function)
